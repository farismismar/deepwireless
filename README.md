# EESC 7v86 Selected Topics in Wireless Communications: Deep Learning for 5G

This is a code repository that allows its user to generate statistics of a multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) wireless channel and both QAM and QPSK symbols (Gray coded).  The simulation is for a single OFDM symbol and a single user.

MIMO precoding is done via singular value decomposition (SVD), waterfilling, and identity.  Beamforming through the use of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook is implemented.

Several channel operations are performed: channel estimation, channel equalization, and symbol detection.

Channel estimation is performed through the use of least squares estimation and the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) formula.

Channel equalization is performed through the choices of zero forcing and MMSE equalizers.

Symbol detection is performed through three different algorithms: 1) maximum likelihood, 2) unsupervised learning, and 3) deep neural networks.

Symbol quantization through Lloyd-Max is also implemented from a forked implementation (credits in source code).

Statistics reported are the channel estimation mean squared error, signal to noise ratio (both TX and RX), TX Eb/N0, bit error rate, pathloss, and block error rate.

The additional file `PlottingUtils.py` is a class used to plot probability density functions (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for various configurations (joint, marginal) PDFs and CDFs, box plots, and PDFs/CDFs for mulitple variables on a single plot.

The preprint updates will be uploaded to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17713).  The code is best run on Python `3.9.13` on Windows with TensorFlow `2.10.0` with GPU support with a supported NVIDIA GPU running cuDNN `9.5.0` and cuda `12.6.2`.
